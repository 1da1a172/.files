# Options for GnuPG
#
# Unless the "--options filename" option is given, GnuPG uses $GNUPGHOME/gpg.conf
# An options file can contain any long options which are available in GnuPG.
#
# This implementation is a combination of the Riseup OpenPGP Best Practices,
# default config, and the VT recommendations


#------------------------------
# default key
#------------------------------

# Default key to sign with. If this option is not used, the default key is the
# first key found in the secret keyring

# When verifying a signature made from a subkey, ensure that the cross
# certification "back signature" on the subkey is present and valid.
# This protects against a subtle attack against subkeys that can sign.
